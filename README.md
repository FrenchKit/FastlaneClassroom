# fastlane: from Zero to Hero

This repository contains all the resources needed to attend the “fastlane from Zero to Hero” classroom at [FrenchKit 2017](http://frenchkit.fr) on 09/23. 

The slides displayed during this classroom are [available on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/juli1quere/fastlane-from-0-to-hero).

## Requirement

Attending this classroom requires: 
- A recent version of **fastlane (>= 2.57.2)** [here is how to install it](https://docs.fastlane.tools/#choose-your-installation-method).
- The last stable version of **Xcode 9** (as of today: Xcode 9.0). You can [download it here](https://developer.apple.com/download/).
- The last version of **Xcode command line tools** (just execute `xcode-select --install`).
- Having an overall idea of how iOS App Store release works.

Please, try to fulfill these requirements **before** coming to the classroom ;).

## Emoji Kit

Emoji Kit is a sample project that will be used for all the demos. This is a simple catalog of emojis based on the iOS default `Master-Detail Application` template. It follows the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). This project is not really interesting by itself. But what can fastlane do with it… 


## Credits

The Emoji datasource is an extract from [the Emojibase project](https://github.com/milesj/emojibase/) by Miles Johnson.
