# Emoji Kit

Emoji Kit is a demo project for the “fastlane from Zero to Hero” classroom at [FrenchKit 2017](http://frenchkit.fr). This is a simple catalog of emojis based on the iOS default `Master-Detail Application` template. It follows the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). This project is not really interesting. But what can fastlane do with it… 

## Requirement

Attending this classroom requires: 
- A Mac with macOS Sierra (10.12),
- The last stable version of Xcode 8 (8.3.3),
- The last version of Xcode command line tools (just execute `xcode-select --install`),
- A recent version of fastlane (>= 2.5.5) [here is how to install it](https://docs.fastlane.tools/#choose-your-installation-method).
